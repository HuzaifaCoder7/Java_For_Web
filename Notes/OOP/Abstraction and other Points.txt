Abstraction is a process in which we hide background implementation details. It only provides that information
which company provides or essential information which user wants.
* We can achieve abstraction by 2 methods:
 1: By "abstract" keyword
 2: By Interface [ BluePrint ]

* We can achieve 100% percent abstraction using interface.

* If we create a class abstract than we cannot create object of that.

* It only contains the declaration if you want implementation then you have to create another class and use
  'extends' for 1 and use 'implements' for 2.
