* 'this' keyword  is used to refer current reference.

* 'final' keyword is used to declare a method final so it cannot be overridden. It can also be used in class. If we use final keyword in Parent
class, we will not be able to extend our child class. Means Inheritance and Polymorphism is not possible with 'final' keyword.
