An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies.

* Interface class cannot have constructor because method implentation is not allowed in interface class.

* To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kinda like inherited) by another class with the implements keyword (instead of extends). The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class.

* Interface allows more security to hide certain data we want.
