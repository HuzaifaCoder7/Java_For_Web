* One Object inherit(gain) all the properties and behaviors of a Parent object but not class.
* One class which tends another class.
* Object holds value class does not.

* In Java there are 5 types of inheritance:
 1: Single level [ When you are extending one class ] 
 2: Multi-level [ When you are extending one class and again create new class and extends second one ]
 3: Multiple [ When you are extending properties from 2 classes to one ]
 4: Hybrid [ When you are using mixture of 2 inheritances ]
 5: Hierarcial [ When 2 classes are extending from 1 class ]

* In Java Multiple inheritance is not possible but we can achieve using "Interface".
