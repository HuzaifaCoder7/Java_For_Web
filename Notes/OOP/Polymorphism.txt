Polymorphism is derived from 2 words. "Poly" means many and "morphism" means forms. We can achieve Polymorphism by 2 ways:
 1: Compile time polymorphism --> [ Method Overloading ] --> Also known as Static type polymorphism
 2: Run-time polymorphism --> [ Method Overriding ] --> Also known as Dynamic type polymorphism

* METHOD-OVERLOADING: In this we can create 2 methods with same name within same class but we have to change following:
  1: It should change return type OR
  2: It should change number of Parameters OR
  3: It should change type of Parameters

* METHOD-OVERRIDING: It is same as method-overloading but it is within different classes.

* There are 3 types of variables in Java OOP:
   1: Global
   2: Local
   3: Instance [ Object related ]
