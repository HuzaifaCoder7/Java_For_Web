--> Consider class as a category just like animals. Animal is a category and cat is a object. Here animal is a Class
    and cat is an Object.
--> Class is a keyword.

2: In class you will see three things:
   (i)    Data Members
   (ii)   Methods or Member function
   (iii)  Constructor
-->  Our main [ public static void main(String[] args) ] lies in Method(ii) category.

3: Keywords are the words which have special meaning in Programing language.

4: Java is an OOP language it means you would always make an class and write your program in it [ .... ]

5: In Java String is a class that's why we have to capitalize its first letter while other int, char, float are
   considered data-types.

6: Java is not fully Object-Oriented.
