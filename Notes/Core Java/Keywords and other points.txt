* For Encapsulation we use getters & setters with the concept of getter & setter we can take an example that
  imagine you have empId variable in class you would not want that anybody can edit that empId so you would 
  declare it private and you would grant access to specific user with getter&setter. You would use setter so 
  only you can set Id and you would use getter so anybody can see that but cannot edit that.
