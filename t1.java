//! Important Note before writing Java Program.
/*
 ? 1: Every Java program has a class and it is also known as class defination. For now just remember that the name of class and filename should be same if its not then it will throw an error.
 ? 2: In every Java program there is a main function from where our main program starts. Java compiler starts executing code from main function.
 ? 3: System.out.println is a function just like "cout" in C++ or "print" in Python the "println" means to print the statement in new line.
 ? 4: Comments are completely ignored by Java Compiler.
